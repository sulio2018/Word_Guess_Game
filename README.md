# Word_Guess_Game

This is my first Javascript assignment so please be patient.

Instructions:
-Please make sure only to use text keys on your keyboard.
-All guess words are related to keywords about the environment.

There is one bug I have not been able to correct. If you select a word you have already incorrectly chosen, the game will double count it and subtract a try.
